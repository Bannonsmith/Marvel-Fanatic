# Marvel-Fanatic

**Purpose:** The purpose of the Marvel Fanatic website is to provide our users with a site that will allow them to locate their favorite characters, comics, and events. 

**How to use:** When users land on our website they have the option to register or log in. You can use the site without registering but you will not be able to save your favorites unless you register and log in.  On the homepage you have a carousel that displays information that you can click on that will lead you to Marvels website where you can read, purchase, or watch inforamtion about that content. User can then go to the Characters page where they can type in any Marvel character and it will pull from the Marvel API and display the latest comic and powers. Users can then go to Events page(give it a second to load. If not then press the events button again and it should auto populate) were they can see current up to date events from the marvel universe. Users can then go to the Movies page were they can access movie trailers and watch directly from the site. The last option is the Favorites page were you must sign in to save your favorite characters.
